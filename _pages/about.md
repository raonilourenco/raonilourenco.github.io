Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT) at the University of Luxembourg.
 
I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Center for Responsible AI at the New York University, under Professor Julia Stoyanovich. Before, I worked with Professor Juliana Freire at the Visualization Image and Data Analysis (VIDA) lab at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, where I got a Ph.D. in Computer Science. I have an M.S. in Information Engineering from UFABC and a B.S. in Computer Science from UFAM, in Brazil. 

My research has focused on data management approaches to ethical AI, pipeline debugging, data debugging, and AutoML. 

I also worked as a software engineer in several R&D institutes for more than ten years.
